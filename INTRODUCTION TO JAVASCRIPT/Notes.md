## Introduction

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at **Netscape**.

### Development and Naming History

- **Mocha**: The language was initially named "Mocha" by its creator, Brendan Eich, during its development in September 1995.
- **LiveScript**: Before its official release, the name was changed to "LiveScript".
- **JavaScript**: In December 1995, when it was first introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 Beta 3, the name was changed again to "JavaScript" to capitalize on the popularity of Java, even though the two languages are distinct and developed independently.

### Company

- **Mozilla Foundation**: Continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5, which is identical to ES5.

### ECMA

- **European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)**: Responsible for standardizing JavaScript under the name ECMAScript.

### JavaScript Engines in Different Browsers

- **Google Chrome**: V8 engine
- **Mozilla Firefox**: SpiderMonkey engine
- **Safari (Apple)**: JavaScriptCore engine
- **Internet Explorer**: Chakra engine
- **Opera**: V8 engine

### Node.js

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment


Ryan Dahl invented Node.js in 2009. Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting. 
Why was Node.js invented? 
To address the limitations of existing web servers and coding methods
To provide a single programming language for web application development
To enable developers to handle high-volume concurrent connections
What are some features of Node.js? 
Uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine
Uses an event loop and low-level I/O API
Has an asynchronous, event-driven model
Supports the latest ECMAScript standards
Can efficiently handle thousands of concurrent connections


<!-- The newest version of JavaScript is called ECMAScript 2023 or ES2023 for short.  -->
